# OutlookRemindersOnTop
Forces Outlook reminders to be on top of all other windows, so you don't miss anything!

That's all there is to it, really.  This program runs in the background, and forces any Outlook reminder
windows to be on top of all windows.  The only setup is by right clicking on the system tray icon, and setting 
if you want the program to start automatically at login.
